# Repository
This is an example GitHub repository. The main function of the repository is storing all your codes and scripts. When making changes on files, it is recommended that you use the GitHub Desktop application, as the process is much easier. 

One repository can have many versions (branches), but the master version (branch) is the main one. As mentioned in the presentation, commonly, no direct change should be made to the master branch. 

The repository also includes other functions, such as issues and projects, which we will introduce and use as well in the future.

# Branches
Branches are different version of your files. There is one branch currently in this repository - the "master" branch. By creating more branches, you can work on different copies of the same file. You can create a branch using GitHub Desktop.
Normally, branches are created to address individual issues or implement features to your program. 
We'll talk more about branches in future lessons.

# Your Task
Your tasks for this lesson are:
1. Clone this repository to your device.
2. Create a new branch named with your name. Connect words with dash ('-') and publish the branch. 
Example branch name: "Angela-Qin"
3. Switch to the new branch. 
4. Create a new, empty text file named with your name and student ID, and push that change to the main repository. Connect words with dash ('-').
Example file name: "Angela-Qin-123456.txt". 
5. Commit to the branch with adequate summary and description (e.g. "addition of new file")
6. Create a pull request and submit with adequate description. Do NOT merge the request.
